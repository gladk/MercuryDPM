xballs / Xb2 / Xb3 - program description
===================================

('Xb2' is a shell script that calls 'xballs' with option: '-format 8')
('Xb3' is a shell script that calls 'xballs' with option: '-format 7')

xballs visualizes coordinate data of spheres in 2D and draws them in a
X11 window. The data-file must have one of the following formats:
(The format is defined by the -format 3|4|5|6|7|8|13|14 option; 
the default format for xballs is 5, the default format for Xb2 is 8.)

Data-Format

Screen output:
--------------

xballs creates a window with four smaller child-windows.
       Counting from top left to the right and then to the bottom:
Window 1 contains particles at their position.

Windows 2 and 3 contains averages in slices where different
colors mean:
   - Red: denisty in horizontal or vertical slices at right and bottom
     window respectively.
   - Grey: denisty in horizontal slices at right window (only the inner
      third of the system is averaged).
   - Blue: Kinetic energy
   - Green: Rotational energy

Window 4 contains information about number of particles and time

the coloured bar at the left of window 2 gives the color-scale in 
the order of increasing value.


Call of programm:
=================

Xb2 -f datafile [-other options]

If the datafile is in correct format, the upper line calls the
program. Xb2 opens a X-window and draws 4 subwindows. The top-left
window is for the visualisation of the spheres. The bottom-right
window shows the number N, the actual time and the average value
of the height of the venter of mass and of the velocity.
The top-right and bottom-left windows show density (red), velocity
(blue), and angular velocity (green) of horizontal and vertical 
slices of the system respectively. 

other options are ...
# indicates an integer number
--->>> (the values in brackets give the defaults)

datafile:

-f 'datafile'   define the filename
                'datafile'='-' allows stdin-input
-format #       5, 8, 13 or 14 columns (see above)

-wf 'wallfile'  wall configuration data file
                (up to now xballs will plot just infinitely long lines)
                One dataset consists of seven numbers
                       1 ... wall-type (for future use)
                   2,3,4 ... normal vector to the wall
                   5,6,7 ... point the wall goes through
                You can ignore the numbers 1,3, and 6, but must give them !
                You need to wpecify -nw # (see below)
-nw #           number of walls to be read and plotted from wallfile

-of "filename.format"   creates one file per frame to the file ######.filename.format
                        ###### is the frame-number, starting with 000001 and ending 
                        with 999999. -of uses the command "import" and is successful
                        only on machines which have this command. -of draws only the
                        picture window, not the data windows.
                        filename is arbitrary, format defines the output format, as
                        for example: ps, eps, giff, sgi, ...
-xof "filename.format"  see -of, but the whole window is drawn ...

-vector   show the displacement vector from one time to the next
          to be combined with -step. Note also that -vscale can
          be used to change the length of the vectors - default is
          a length of 1/100, -vscale 100 sets it to 1, -vscale 1000 to 10.

            View directions are given for the positive x,y,z-axis
            where RH and LH indicates right- or left-handed coordinates

            draw rear particles (farther away) somewhat more grey
            the input parameter shifts the greyscale  
            meaning: is proportional to the fog-intensity
